to compile:
javac "programName".java

to run:
java "programName"

In Java, the convention is that the name of the Java source file should match the name of the public class defined within that file. 
This convention is not just for naming aesthetics but is a fundamental requirement of the Java language. 

Inner Classes
Java supports nesting classes; a class can be a member of another class.
Creating an inner class is quite simple. Just write a class within a class. Unlike a class, an inner class can be private. Once you declare an inner class private, it cannot be accessed from an object outside the class.

class Robot {
    int id;
    Robot(int i) {
      id = i;
      Brain b = new Brain();
      b.think();
    }
  
    private class Brain {
      public void think() {
        System.out.println(id + " is thinking");
      }
    }
  
  }

Comparing Objects
Remember that when you create objects, the variables store references to the objects.
So, when you compare objects using the equality testing operator (==), it actually compares the references and not the object values.

class Animal {
    String name;
    Animal(String n) {
      name = n;
    }
  }
