-- You are working on the Employees table, which stores the names and salaries of employees.

-- You need to calculate the taxes for the salaries and output them as a new column.

-- The tax percentage is based on the salary amount:

-- 0 - 1500:       10%
-- 1501 - 2000: 20%
-- 2001+:          30%
-- Output the firstname, lastname, salary and tax columns of the table, sorted by the lastname column in ascending order.

-- Hint: To calculate the percentage of a number, simply multiply it by the percentage divided by 100. For example, to get 10%, multiply the number by 0.1.

-- SELECT * This retrieves all columns 

SELECT 
    firstname, 
    lastname, 
    salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 0 AND 1500 THEN salary * 0.1
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 1501 AND 2000 THEN salary * 0.2
        ELSE salary * 0.3
    END AS tax
FROM 
    Employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname ASC;
