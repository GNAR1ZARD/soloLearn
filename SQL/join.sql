-- You are working on the library database, which contains the Books and Authors tables.

-- Columns of the Books table: id, name, year, author_id.

-- Columns of the Authors table: id, name.

 

-- Write a query to get the author names and the number of books they have in the Books table.

-- Note that some authors do not have any books associated with them. In this case, the result needs to include their names and have 0 as the count. The count column should be called books in the result.

-- Sort the result by the number of books, from highest to lowest.

SELECT 
    Authors.name AS name,
    COUNT(Books.id) AS books
FROM 
    Authors
LEFT JOIN 
    Books ON Authors.id = Books.author_id
GROUP BY 
    Authors.name
ORDER BY 
    books DESC;
