# Character classes can also match ranges of characters.
# Some examples:
# The class [a-z] matches any lowercase alphabetic character.
# The class [G-P] matches any uppercase character from G to P.
# The class [0-9] matches any digit.
# Multiple ranges can be included in one class. For example, [A-Za-z] matches a letter of any case.

# Place a ^ at the start of a character class to invert it.
# This causes it to match any character other than the ones included.
# Other metacharacters such as $ and ., have no meaning within character classes.
# The metacharacter ^ has no meaning unless it is the first character in a class.
