String Functions
Python contains many useful built-in functions and methods to accomplish common tasks.
join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator.
replace - replaces one substring in a string with another.
startswith and endswith - determine if there is a substring at the start and end of a string, respectively.
To change the case of a string, you can use lower and upper.
The method split is the opposite of join, turning a string with a certain separator into a list.

Some examples:
print(", ".join(["spam", "eggs", "ham"]))
#prints "spam, eggs, ham"

print("Hello ME".replace("ME", "world"))
#prints "Hello world"

print("This is a sentence.".startswith("This"))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".endswith("sentence."))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".upper())
# prints "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

print("AN ALL CAPS SENTENCE".lower())
#prints "an all caps sentence"

print("spam, eggs, ham".split(", "))
#prints "['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']"

Numeric Functions
To find the maximum or minimum of some numbers or a list, you can use max or min.
To find the distance of a number from zero (its absolute value), use abs.
To round a number to a certain number of decimal places, use round.
To find the total of a list, use sum.

Some examples:
print(min(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1))
print(max([1, 4, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8]))
print(abs(-99))
print(abs(42))
print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

map
The built-in functions map and filter are very useful higher-order functions that operate on lists (or similar objects called iterables).
The function map takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and returns a new iterable with the function applied to each argument.
