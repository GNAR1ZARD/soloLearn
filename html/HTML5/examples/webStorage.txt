HTML5 Web Storage
With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality.

[u]The Advantages of Web Storage[/u]
- More secure
- Faster
- Stores a larger amount of data
- Stored data is not sent with every server request

Types of Web Storage Objects
There are two types of web storage objects:
- sessionStorage()
- localStorage()

[u]Local vs. Session[/u]
- Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
- Local Storage stores data with no expiration date

Working with Values
The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar.
The data is stored as key/value pairs.

Storing a Value:
localStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");

Getting a Value:
//this will print the value
alert(localStorage.getItem("key1"));

Removing a Value:
localStorage.removeItem("key1");

Removing All Values:
localStorage.clear();
